# Components

Sons of PHP creates and maintains various Components. Components are reusable
libraries. With the Components, we try to have as few dependencies as possible.
If additional functionality is needed, the dependencies are broken out into
specific packages.

If you are having issues, please see [Reporting Issues](../reporting-issues.md)
