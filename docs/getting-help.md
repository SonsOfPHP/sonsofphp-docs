# Ways to get help and Ways to help yourself

Need more help? The [Sons of PHP][sonsofphp] have many different ways you can
get more help.

## Documentation

This website is basically the *RTFM*.

## Source Code

The ultimate "RTFM". If the documentation on the site is lacking, there are gems
in the source code.

## GitHub Discussions

If the documentation and source code have failed you, you can get help by going
to the [Sons Of PHP Organization Discussions][discussions] and searching for
answers. If you cannot find any, create a new topic.
